# Architecture

The `telegram` and `telegram.ext` packages contain several classes that make writing (chat)bots easy.
You have met most of them in the [[tutorial|Extensions-â€“-Your-first-Bot]].
Because all of that can be a bit overwhelming, the below diagram gives you an overview of how the different components interact with each other.

![PTB Architecture](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/VYfQoTJBY1Mo.png?o=1)

`python-telegram-bot` is designed such that you can adjust it to many use cases.
In particular, many components/features are optional and some can even be fully customized.

## Opt-in and Opt-out components

### Fetching updates

The `Updater` class is there to fetch updates from the Bot API for your bot.
But you don't need to use it.
If you want to implement a custom mechanism to fetch updates (e.g. a [[custom webhook setup|Webhooks]], you can just put your updates into the `Application.update_queue` or even manually call `Application.process_update`.
To build an `Application` that doesn't use an `Updater`, simply pass `None` to `ApplicationBuilder.updater`.

### Scheduling tasks

The `JobQueue` class integrates scheduling logic into the setup of `telegram.ext`.
This feature is optional.
If you don't need/want to use a `JobQueue`, simply pass `None` to `ApplicationBuilder.job_queue`.

### Arbitrary `callback_data`

The `CallbackDataCache` is the backend for caching arbitrary `callback_data`.
This feature must be explicitly activated to be used.
Please see [[this wiki page|Arbitrary-callback_data]] for more info.

### Default values

The `Defaults` class allows you to specify default values for parameters that appear quite often, e.g. the `parse_mode` parameter.
This is an opt-in feature.
Please have a look at [[this wiki page|Adding-defaults-to-your-bot]] for more info.

### Persisting data across restarts

By default, data like `Application.{chat, bot, user}_data` is stored in-memory and is lost when the bot shuts down.
PTB includes an optional functionality to persist data across restarts, which `BasePersistence` as interface class at it's core.
Head to [[this page|Making-your-bot-persistent]] for more info.

## Customizing Components

### Networking

By default, PTB will use the `httpx` library for the networking backend, i.e. making requests to the Bot API.
However, you are free to use a custom backend implementation as well.
For this, you'll have to implement the `BaseRequest` interface class and pass two instances of your custom networking class to
`ApplicationBuilder.request` and `ApplicationBuilder.get_updates_request`.

### Update handlers

The `Handler` interface class is the most import class when it comes to the question of how the `Application` processes updates.
PTB comes with a number of [[built-in handler|Types-of-Handler]] which cover most important use cases.
However, if you want to implement a custom logic of when an update should be handled, you can also write a custom implementation of `Handler` and use that.

### Persistence

As mentioned above, PTBs persistence functionality is based on the interface class `BasePersistence`.
To use persistence in PTB, you use an implementation of this class.
PTB comes already ships two implementations (see [[this page|Making-your-bot-persistent]]), but you are very welcome to implement a persistence class for your own serialization backend.

### Customizing the `context` parameter

The class `CallbackContext` is a central part of the handler/job callbacks in PTB and more advanced users may want to add custom behavior to this class.
You can do so by passing an instance of the `ContextTypes` to `ApplicationBuilder.context_types`.
Have a look at [this example](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples#contexttypesbotpy) for example use cases.
