## Introduction

This transition guide aims to easy transitions from v13.x to v20.0 by listing relevant changes between these versions.
It's important to note that this transition guide will not cover every last one of the many smaller changes that came along with the bigger structural changes.
If you notice that some non trivial change is missing in here, feel free to add it.

# Transition Script

We have prepared a script that is aimed at easing the transition for you.
Note that this script currently just does some regex-based search & replace take some of the transition work off your shoulders.
It is no way a substitute for reading this transition guide and manually adjusting your code base.
In addition to the script, we recommend using a language interpreter (e.g. `pylint`) and a static type checker (e.g. `mypy`) on your code base to minimize the trial-and-error time during transitioning at a minimum.
You can find the script [[here|/assets/v20_code_transition.py]].

Contributions that fine tune or extend the script are welcome (you must clone the wiki repo to make changes)!

# Structural changes & Deprecations

## Overall architecture

`ext.Updater` is no longer the entry point to a PTB program and we have replaced the `ext.Dispatcher` class with the new class `ext.Application`.

The `Application` is the new entry point to a PTB program and binds all its components together. The following diagram gives you an overview.

<details><summary>Click to show the diagram</summary>

[[/assets/ptb_architecture.png]]

</details>

When initializing an `Application`, many settings can be configured for the individual components.
In an effort to make this instantiation both clear and clean, we adopted the so-called [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern).
This means that instead of passing arguments directly to `Application`, one creates a builder via `Application.builder()` and then specifies all required arguments via that builder.
Finally, the `Application` is created by calling `builder.build()`. A simple example is

```python
from telegram.ext import Application, CommandHandler
application = Application.builder().token('TOKEN').build()
application.add_handler(CommandHandler('start', start_callback))
application.run_polling()
```

We hope that this design makes it easier for you to understand what goes where and also simplifies setups of customized solutions, e.g. if you want to use a custom webhook.

There is also a [[standalone wiki page|Builder-Pattern]] just about this topic.

## `asyncio`

The deepest structural change is introducing the `asyncio` module into `python-telegram-bot`.

> [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is a library to write concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax.

What does this mean and why do we care?

`python-telegram-bot` is a library with the main purpose of communicating with the Telegram Bot API via web requests.
When making web requests, your code usually spends a *lot* of time with - waiting.
Namely, waiting for a response from Telegram.
The same holds for many so-called input-output (I/O) tasks.
Instead of sitting around, your program could already do other stuff in that time.

So far, PTB has build on the [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) library to overcome this issue.

`asyncio` is a modern alternative to `threading` that comes with multiple advantages.
Covering those or an introduction to how using `asyncio` works, is sadly beyond the scope of this transition guide or the PTB resources in general.
Searching for `python asyncio introduction` or `python asyncio vs threading` in your favorite search engine will yield numerous results that will help you get up to speed.

The main points of what `asyncio` changed in PTB are:

* PTB doesn't use threads anymore. It is also not thread safe!
* All API methods of `telegram.Bot` are now coroutine functions, i.e. you have to `await` them
* All handler & job callbacks must be coroutine functions, i.e. you need to change `def callback(update, context)` to `async def callback(update, context)`.
* the `run_async` parameter of the handlers was replaced by the `block` parameter, which has a similar functionality. More details on this can be found on [[this page|Concurrency]].
* The method `Dispatcher.run_async` doesn't exist anymore. Something that comes close to its functionality is `Application.create_task` (more on `Application` below). More details on this can be found on [[this page|Concurrency]].
* All methods that make calls coroutines or perform any I/O bound tasks are now coroutine functions.
This includes all abstract methods of `BasePersistence`. Listing them all here would be too long. When in doubt, please consult the documentation at [ReadTheDocs](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io).

## Optional Dependencies

Some of the functionality of the `telegram` and `telegram.ext` modules rely on 3rd party dependencies.
Since these features are optional to use and we aim to keep the footprint of `python-telegram-bot` small, we have reduced the number of 3rd party dependencies that automatically get's installed along with `python-telegram-bot` to a minimum.
As of v20.0a5, only the 3rd party library `httpx` is installed, which is used for the default networking backend `HTTPXRequest`.
If you wish to use any of the optional features of the `telegram` and `telegram.ext` modules, you will have to specify that while installing `python-telegram-bot` from now on.
Please have a look at [the readme](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/#optional-dependencies) for further details.

## Refinement of the public API

We've made an effort to make it clearer which parts of `python-telegram-bot` can be considered to be part of the public interface that users are allowed to use. To phrase it the other way around: Which parts are internals of `python-telegram-bot` are implementation details that might change without notice. Notably this means:

1. Only non-private modules are part of the public API and you should import classes & functions the way they are described in the docs. E.g. `from telegram.error import TelegramError` is fine, but `from telegram._message import Message` is strongly discouraged - use `from telegram import Message` instead.
2. We have removed the module `telegram.utils`. The parts of this module that we consider to be part of the public API have been moved into the modules `telegram.{helpers, request, warnings}`.

## `__slots__`

We introduced the usage of `__slots__` in v13.6, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance. In v20 we removed the ability to set custom attributes on all objects except for `ext.CallbackContext`. To store data, we recommend to use PTB's built-in mechanism for [storing data](Storing-bot,-user-and-chat-related-data) instead. If you want to add additional functionality to some class, we suggest subclassing it.

## Keyword-Only arguments

Since v20.0a1, all arguments of bot methods that were added by PTB are now keyword-only arguments.
Most importantly, this covers the `*_timeout` and `api_kwargs` arguments.

## Initialization of Telegram Classes

Since v20.0a5, `TelegramObject` and it's subclasses no longer accept arbitrary keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). These were formerly used to ensure that PTB wouldn't break when Telegram added new fields to existing classes.
Instead, `TelegramObject` and it's subclasses now have an argument `api_kwargs` that will be used to store fields that are passed by Telegram and that PTB did not yet incorporate. These fields will also be available via the `api_kwargs` *attribute*.

## Removed features

We made a cut and dropped all deprecated functionality. Most importantly, this includes the old-style handler API, which was deprecated in [[Version 12|Transition-guide-to-Version-12.0#context-based-callbacks]], and the `MessageQueue`. As replacement for the `MessageQueue`, `telegram.ext.{Base, AIO}RateLimiter` where introduced in v20.0a3 (see also [this wiki page](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Avoiding-flood-limits)).

# Changes for specific modules, classes & functions

## `telegram`

Previously some parts of `telegram.{error, constants}` where available directly via the `telegram` package - e.g. `from telegram import TelegramError`. These imports will no longer work. Only classes that directly reflect the official Bot API are now available directly via the `telegram` package. Constants and errors are available via the modules `telegram.{error, constants}` - e.g. `from telegram.error import TelegramError`.

### Several classes

Previously, some classes (like `telegram.{Message, User, Chat}`) had an attribute `bot` that was used for the shortcuts (e.g. `Message.reply_text`). This attribute was removed.
Instead, the new method `TelegramObject.{set, get}_bot()` are used.

### Networking backend

Previously, the class `telegram.utils.request.Request` formed the networking backend of PTB.
This class has been removed.
Instead, there is the new module `telegram.request`, which contains an interface class `BaseRequest` as well as an implementation `HTTPXRequest` of that class via the `httpx` library.
By default, the `HTTPXRequest` class is used for the networking backend.
Advanced users may use a custom backend by implementing a custom subclass of `BaseRequest`.
See [[this page|Architecture]] for more information on that.

### `telegram.ChatAction`

This class was removed as it is not part of the official Bot API. Use `telegram.constants.ChatAction` instead.

### `telegram.constants`

This module was rewritten from scratch. The constants are now grouped with the help of [Enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.Enum).

### `telegram.Bot`

* The class has a new argument `get_updates_request` in addition to `request` and the corresponding request instance will be used exclusively for calling `getUpdates`.
* The argument `media` of `Bot.edit_message_media` is now the first positional argument as specified by the Bot API.
* The argument `url` of `Bot.set_webhook` is now required as specified by the Bot API.
* The argument `description` of `Bot.set_chat_description` is now optional as specified by the Bot API.

### `telegram.EncryptedPassportElement`

The argument `hash` is now the second positional argument as specified by the Bot API.

### `telegram.error`

`telegram.error.Unauthorized` was replaced by `telegram.error.Forbidden`.
Moreover, `telegram.error.Forbidden` is now only raised if your bot tries to perform actions that it doesn't have enough rights for.
In case your bot token is invalid, `telegram.error.InvalidToken` is raised.

### `telegram.File`

The method `File.download` was split into the two methods `File.download_to_drive` and `File.download_to_memory`.
For `download_to_drive`, the `custom_path` parameter now also accepts `pathlib.Path` objects.
Moreover instead of returning the file path as string, it's now returned as `pathlib.Path` object.

### `telegram.ForceReply`

The argument `force_reply` was removed, since it *always* must be `True` anyway.

### `telegram.InlineQuery.answer`

If both parameters `current_offset` and `auto_pagination` are supplied, the method now raises a `ValueError` rather than a `TypeError`.

### `telegram.InputFile.is_image`

This method was removed in v20.0a1.

### `telegram.ParseMode`

This class was removed as it is not part of the official Bot API. Use `telegram.constants.ParseMode` instead.

### `telegram.PassportFile`

The argument `file_size` is now optional as specified by the Bot API.

### `telegram.ReplyMarkup`

This class was removed as it is not part of the official Bot API.

### `telegram.VideoChat`

The argument `users` is now optional as specified by the Bot API.

## `telegram.ext`

### `BasePersistence`

#### `asyncio`

All abstract methods are now coroutine functions as implementations should be able to perform I/O tasks in a non-blocking way.

#### Data must be copyable

Any data passed to persistence will be copied with [`copy.deepcopy`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy).
This requirement is in place to avoid race conditions.

#### Persisting `telegram.Bot` instances.

In [[Version 13|Transition-guide-to-Version-13.0]], we introduced a mechanism that replaces any `telegram.Bot` instance with a placeholder automatically *before* `update_*_data` was called and inserts the instance back into the return value of `get_*_data`. Unfortunately, this mechanism has proven to be unstable and also slow.

We have therefore decided to remove this functionality. `Bot` instances should still not be serialized, but handling this is now the responsibility of the specific implementation of `BasePersistence`. For example, `ext.PicklePersistence` uses the built-in functionality of the `pickle` module to achieve the same effect in a more reliable way.

More detailed information on this can be found in the documentation of `{Base, Pickle}Persistence`.

#### Return value of `get_{user, chat}_data`

`BasePersistence.get_{user, chat}_data` are no longer expected to return `collections.defaultdict`. Instead, they may return plain `dicts`.

#### Abstract methods

`BasePersistence` made a full transition to an abstract base class. This means that now all methods that a subclass should implement are marked as `abc.abstractmethod`. If e.g. you don't need `update_bot_data` because your persistence class is not supposed to store `bot_data`, you will still have to override that method, but you can simply make it `pass`.

#### `store_*_data`

The parameters & attributes `store_{user,chat,bot}_data` were removed. Instead, these settings were combined into the argument/attribute `store_data`, which accepts an instance of the new helper class [`telegram.ext.PersistenceInput`](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/telegram.ext.persistenceinput.html#telegram-ext-persistenceinput).

Note that `callback_data` is now persisted by default.

### `CallbackContext`

* `CallbackContext.from_error` has a new optional argument `job`. When an exception happens inside a `ext.Job` callback, this parameter will be passed.
* Accordingly, the attribute `CallbackContext.job` will now also be present in error handlers if the error was caused by a `ext.Job`.
* v20.0a1 removed the constant `CallbackContext.DEFAULT_TYPE`. That constant can now be found as `ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE`.

### `CommandHandler`

The attribute `commands` was made immutable in v20.0a1.

### `ConversationHandler`

ConversationHandler now raises warnings for more handlers which are added in the wrong context/shouldn't be in the handler at all.

### `filters`

The `ext.filters` module was rewritten almost from scratch and uses a new namespace policy. The changes are roughly as follows:

1. `telegram.ext.Filters` no longer exists. Instead, use the module `telegram.ext.filters` directly. For example, `Filters.text` has to be replaced by `filters.TEXT`
2. Already instantiated filters that don't need arguments are now in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, e.g. `filters.TEXT`. Filter *classes* that do need arguments to be used are now in `CamelCase`, e.g. `filters.User`.
3. For filters that are closely related, we now use a namespace class to group them. For example, `filters.Document` can not be used in `MessageHandler`. To filter for messages with *any* document attached, use `filters.Document.ALL` instead.

Moreover, filters are no longer callable. To check if a filter accepts an update, use the new syntax `my_filter.check_update(update)` instead.

### `Handler`

v20.0a1 renamed the class `Handler` to `BaseHandler` in an effort to emphasize that this class is an abstract base class.

### `PrefixHandler`

Since v20.0a1, this is no longer a subclass of `CommandHandler`.
Moreover, the prefixes and commands are no longer mutable.

### `JobQueue`

#### New arguments `{chat, user}_id`

All scheduling methods (`JobQueue.run_*`) have two new arguments `{chat, user}_id`, which allows to easily associate a user/chat with a job. By specifying these arguments, the corresponding ID will be available in the job callback via `context.job.{chat, user}_id`.

Moreover, `context.{chat, user}_data` will be available. This has some subtle advantages over the previous workaround `job_queue.run_*(..., context=context.chat_data)` and we recommend using this new feature instead.

#### `context` argument

To address the frequent confusion about `context` vs `context.job.context`, v20.0a1 renamed the argument `context` of all `JobQueue.run_*` methods to `data`.
This also covers the corresponding attribute of `Job`.

#### `Job.run_daily`

Since v20.0a1, the behavior of this method is aligned with `cron`, i.e. 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.

#### `JobQueue.run_monthly`

Unfortunately, the `day_is_strict` argument was not working correctly (see [#2627](../issues/2627)) and was therefore removed. Instead, you can now pass `day='last'` to make the job run on the last day of the month.

### `Job`

#### Removed the attribute `job_queue`

This was removed because if you have access to a job, then you also have access to either the `JobQueue` directly or at least a `CallbackContext` instance, which already contains the `job_queue`.

#### Attribute `Job.context`

To address the frequent confusion about `context` vs `context.job.context`, v20.0a1 renamed the argument `context` of all `JobQueue.run_*` methods to `data` and renamed `Job.context` to `Job.data`.

### `PicklePersistence`

* The argument `filename` was renamed to `filepath` and now also accepts a `pathlib.Path` object
* [Changes to `BasePersistence`](#basepersistence) also affect this class.

We have prepared a script that will help you convert your v13 pickle-files into v20 pickle files.
Note that this script is a best-effort solution for a conversion - for some special cases, a conversion may not be possible without adjusting the v13 data before.
You can find the script [[here|/assets/v20_picklepersistence_transition.py]].

### `Updater`

The sole purpose of this class now is to fetch updates from Telegram. It now only accepts the arguments `bot` and `update_queue` and only has those attributes.

### `Application`/`Dispatcher`

#### `user/chat_data`

If you were modifying the `user/chat_data` of `Dispatcher` directly e.g. by doing `context.dispatcher.chat_data[id] = ...`, then this will now not work. [`Application.user/chat_data`](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram.ext.Application.chat_data) is now read only. Note that `context.chat/user_data[key] = ...` will still work.
