# Groups

* [@pythontelegrambotgroup](https://t.me/pythontelegrambotgroup) is the on-topic user group for questions about PTB. Currently owned by Leandro.
* [@pythontelegrambottalk](https://t.me/pythontelegrambottalk) is the off-topic user group were we can redirect people who have off-topic questions about e.g. python in general and where meta-discussions can happen. Currently owned by @jh0ker

# Bots
Besides the test bots, the developers team maintains a few helper bots:

* [@roolsbot](https://t.me/roolsbot) Is admin in both the on-topic and the off-topic usergroup and runs on [this source](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/rules-bot).
* [@ptb_irc_bridge_bot](https://t.me/ptb_irc_bridge_bot) is a bride to an IRC allowing users with restricted TG access to participate in the on-topic user group. It runs on [this source](https://github.com/FruitieX/teleirc). Currently owned by @jh0ker
* [@PythonTelegramBot](https://t.me/PythonTelegramBot) is owned by the PTB test user account and currently does nothing but blocking the name.

Moreover [@python_telegram_bot](https://t.me/python_telegram_bot) is *not* owned by any of the developers and we don't know who it belongs to.

# Channels

* [@pythontelegrambotchannel](https://t.me/pythontelegrambotchannel) is the offical channel of PTB where the release notes go. Currently owned by Leandro.
* [@ptbfaq](https://t.me/PTBFaq) is a channel that was supposed to hold FAQ messages, but was never really in use (roolsbot can still forward to there?!). @josxa is still admin, be he lost the phone with the owner account.

Moreover [@run_async](https://t.me/run_async) is *not* owned by any of the developers and also irrelevant since the deprecation of `@run_async` in v13.0
