## PTB Resources

PTB offers different resources that help you understand and use the features of the library.

-   The [package documentation][] is the technical reference for
    `python-telegram-bot`. It contains descriptions of all available
    classes, modules, methods and arguments.
-   This [wiki][] is home to number of more elaborate introductions of
    the different features of `python-telegram-bot` and other useful
    resources that go beyond the technical documentation.
-   Our [examples directory][] contains several examples that showcase
    the different features of both the Bot API and
    `python-telegram-bot`. Even if it is not your approach for learning,
    please take a look at `echobot.py`. It is the de facto base for most
    of the bots out there. The code for these examples is released to
    the public domain, so you can start by grabbing the code and
    building on top of it.
-   The [official Telegram Bot API documentation][] is of course always
    worth a read.

## Structure of this Wiki

In the sidebar to the right, you can find all important pages of this wiki. They are roughly organized by the following logic:

### Must read

Introductory articles and frequently referenced pages.

### Concepts & Important Elements

Introductions & explanations of how the components of `telegram.ext` work and interact with each other.

### Notable Features

Elaborate explanation to more advanced features of `telegram.ext`.

### Code Resources

Some other resources that are not exclusively PTB-specific.

### Examples Explained

An effort to make the [examples](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples) even more accessible.
*You are very welcome to extend this section!*

### Networking

Articles about advanced networking questions.

### Other resources

More interesting & helpful stuff that can't be found in any of the above sections.

### Transition Guides

Major versions usually come with breaking changes, i.e. changes that lead to code failing after upgrading. Those guides help to ease the transition.

### Administration

Interesting mostly for the maintainers. They, too, need a place to take notes ðŸ™‚
