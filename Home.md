## About this Wiki
For a long time, our documentation consisted of our [API documentation](http://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/) and README. As a result, the README became simply too big to be useful. In an effort to change that, we moved large parts of our README into different Wiki articles. In the process, we improved the texts with additional information, clearer wording and some cross-references. 


## Contributing to this Wiki
If you stumble upon a part of the wiki that is unclear or missing important points, please go ahead and drop us a message in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/pythontelegrambotgroup), or just edit the part yourself (anyone can contribute). We'd like our wiki to be as complete as possible ðŸ™‚

## Structure of this Wiki

In the sidebar to the right, you can find all important pages of this wiki. They are roughly organized by the following logic:

### Must read

Introductory articles and frequently referenced pages.

### PTB Features & Concepts

Introductions & explanations of the different components the powerful `telegram.ext` offers.

### Code Resources

Some other resources that are not exclusively PTB-specific.

### Examples Explained

An effort to make the [examples](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples) even more accessible.
*You are very welcome to extend this section!*

### Networking

Articles about advanced networking questions.

### Other resources

More interesting & helpful stuff that can't be found in any of the above sections.

### Transition Guides

Major versions usually come with breaking changes, i.e. changes that lead to code failing after upgrading. Those guides help to ease the transition.

### Administration

Interesting mostly for the maintainers. They, too, need a place to take notes ðŸ™‚
